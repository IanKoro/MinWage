-Rewrite grass drawing routine: probably want to have the entire set of 
	grass drawn to one SDL_Surface, so we're not generating everything 
	at once?
	
-work on input- possibly rewrite input class to explore slightly 
different ways of working with it.
			-consider mouse handling, might be important when it comes 
			to in game menus and such

Game states:
		-the usual pause, play, menu states
		-also states for the insides of buildings and various in-game
			menus
			
		-also, organizing the game state into a file for saving games

Movement:
		-look into proper speed management (some ideas covered in this:
				http://www.sdltutorials.com/sdl-collision)
		-rocks as obstacles now basically work, may need to be altered,
		current collision checking is potentially going to be too 
		rigorous once things get more complex.
				

-Maps are now integrated, so to expand it is time to create both art
	assets, and design classes for:
				-backdrop items (roads, etc...)
				-sprite layers:
						-static sprites (rocks, houses, etc...)
						-dynamic sprites (NPCs, items, etc)

-change all graphics to PNG rather than BMP, but continue to expand
		artwork. Enlarge the grass tiles for a better appearance.

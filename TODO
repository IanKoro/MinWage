Work on:

-handleKeyboardInput() in main.cpp needs a complete rewrite: switch to 
a velocity based system, and get the collision handling in a more 
appropriate location

-Replace sprite/object organization. Have a class for each game object
containing sprite data and dimension data

-Inventory/stats: fill those out (inventory.cpp)
-NPCs/Dialogue (characters.cpp)

-screenBlackAnim() and drawSpiral() should be in the same place, either
add such effects to the SDLGraphics class, or create a new effects class

-Rewrite grass drawing routine: probably want to have the entire set of 
	grass drawn to one SDL_Surface, so we're not generating everything 
	at once?
	
-work on input- possibly rewrite input class to explore slightly 
different ways of working with it.
			-consider mouse handling, might be important when it comes 
			to in game menus and such
			
			-create input handling for indoors (could slightly modify 
			current handling so it can be used for all input)

Game states:
		-menu state/pause state essentially implemented
		-indoor state is started, should be similar to a sort of menu
			
		-also, organizing the game state into a file for saving games

Movement:
		-look into proper speed management (some ideas covered in this:
				http://www.sdltutorials.com/sdl-collision)
		-rocks as obstacles now basically work, may need to be altered,
		current collision checking is potentially going to be too 
		rigorous once things get more complex.
				
Sprites:
	-finish the overhead walking anim for indoors
	-then find a way to rotate the sprite. Perhaps generate the images
	for 8 (or just 4) directions, and then load them. Would be faster 
	than implementing code that rotates the sprites

	-possibly create classes for the individual map items? Different
	size map items now functional.


Indoors:
	-Maps need rewrite - xfer map data to .dat files like outdoor maps
		-outdoor code reuse?
	-indoor collision: essentially works. We need to consider a way 
	to differentiate between sprites that block your path, and those 
	that do not. 
	
		Perhaps split the drawing of the sprites in two. Those below a
	certain number get drawn before the player, the others after.
	
	
	-add floor chooser
	-create maps for locations
	
-outdoor maps are now functional, so to expand it is time to create both art
	assets, and design classes for:
				-backdrop items (roads, etc...)
				-sprite layers:
						-static sprites (rocks, houses, etc...)
						-dynamic sprites (NPCs, items, etc)

-change all graphics to PNG rather than BMP, but continue to expand
		artwork. Enlarge the grass tiles for a better appearance.
		
LOCATIONS:
		-home (apartment... with the possibility of up/downgrading?, a house, a cardboard box)
		-bar	
		-jobs (fast food, telemarketing, etc...)
		-groceries
		-drug dealers

-Rewrite grass drawing routine: probably want to have the entire set of 
	grass drawn to one SDL_Surface, so we're not generating everything 
	at once?
	
-work on input- possibly rewrite input class to explore slightly 
different ways of working with it.
			-consider mouse handling, might be important when it comes 
			to in game menus and such
			
			-create input handling for indoors (could slightly modify 
			current handling so it can be used for all input)

Game states:
		-menu state/pause state essentially implemented
		-indoor state is started, should be similar to a sort of menu
			
		-also, organizing the game state into a file for saving games

Movement:
		-look into proper speed management (some ideas covered in this:
				http://www.sdltutorials.com/sdl-collision)
		-rocks as obstacles now basically work, may need to be altered,
		current collision checking is potentially going to be too 
		rigorous once things get more complex.
				
Sprites:
	-finish the overhead walking anim for indoors
	-then find a way to rotate the sprite. Perhaps generate the images
	for 8 (or just 4) directions, and then load them. Would be faster 
	than implementing code that rotates the sprites

	-possibly create classes for the individual map items? Different
	size map items now functional.


Indoors:
	-map system is close to being done. Need to implement a system for 
		indoor doorways (going between rooms), and outdoor ones
		(for entering the indoors)
	-create maps for locations
	
-outdoor maps are now functional, so to expand it is time to create both art
	assets, and design classes for:
				-backdrop items (roads, etc...)
				-sprite layers:
						-static sprites (rocks, houses, etc...)
						-dynamic sprites (NPCs, items, etc)

-change all graphics to PNG rather than BMP, but continue to expand
		artwork. Enlarge the grass tiles for a better appearance.
		
LOCATIONS:
		-home (apartment... with the possibility of up/downgrading?, a house, a cardboard box)
		-bar
		-jobs (fast food, telemarketing, etc...)
		-groceries
		-drug dealers

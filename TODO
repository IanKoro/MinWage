-Rewrite grass drawing routine: probably want to have the entire set of 
	grass drawn to one SDL_Surface, so we're not generating everything 
	at once?
	
-work on input- possibly rewrite input class to explore slightly 
different ways of working with it.
			-consider mouse handling, might be important when it comes 
			to in game menus and such
			
		-rework movement, use the velocity (this will work better with
			collisions with obstacles)

-look into proper speed management (some ideas covered in this:
				http://www.sdltutorials.com/sdl-collision)
				
-SDL_collide was added in, but it's not 100% functional yet, the pixel 
	perfect detection seems to be having some issues with the transparency


-integrate & update map system from prior version
		-grass layer is now redundant
		-two (or three?) layers:
				-backdrop items (roads, etc...)
				-sprite layers:
							-static sprites (rocks, houses, etc...)
							-dynamic sprites (NPCs, items, etc)

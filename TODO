-Rewrite grass drawing routine: probably want to have the entire set of 
	grass drawn to one SDL_Surface, so we're not generating everything 
	at once?
	
-Finish the screenBlackAnim() code
				-Works! But we need to ensure it doesn't get 
					called multiple times due to the way the keyboard
					is handled.

-integrate & update map system from prior version
		-grass layer is now redundant
		-two (or three?) layers:
				-backdrop items (roads, etc...)
				-sprite layers:
							-static sprites (rocks, houses, etc...)
							-dynamic sprites (NPCs, items, etc)

-once maps & additional sprites are considered, work on COLLISION detection

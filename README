v.0.001 (pre-pre-) Alpha
------------------------
				
	Currently this is just the barebones beginning framework, but it is
continually expanding, and will soon be something interesting to play.

	This game will have some elements of both RPG and adventure games,
and a mixture of other features.

	Here are some ideas for things that will be a part of the
gameplay:
		
			-In addition to the usual things, like money and health, the
		player will have to manage boredom and self esteem.

			-Low boredom levels will have serious consequences, but 
		avoiding low will also be difficult, meaning that when funds are
		limited, drugs will be difficult to avoid using.
		
			-A choice of characters to play as (or at least a certain
		level of customizability for characters). This means that race
		and gender can be things that have an effect on your character's
		opportunities, etc...
		
			-And, of course, juggling work and family responsibilities,
		relying on government assistance, options to profit through
		crime, either through theft or drug dealing and prostitution...
		and whatever else seems interesting and feasible.

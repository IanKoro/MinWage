	That's about all there is to say. It's barely even the framework for
the game.

	However, here are some ideas for things that will be connected to
gameplay:
		
			-In addition to the usual things, like money and health, the
		player will have to manage boredom and self esteem.

			-Low boredom levels will have serious consequences, but 
		avoiding low will also be difficult, meaning that when funds are
		limited, drugs will be difficult to avoid using.
		
			-A choice of characters to play as (or at least a certain
		level of customizability for characters). This means that race
		and gender can be things that have an effect on your character's
		opportunities, etc...
		
			-And, of course, juggling work and family responsibilities,
		relying on government assistance, options to profit through
		crime, either through theft or drug dealing and prostitution...
		and whatever else seems interesting and feasible.
